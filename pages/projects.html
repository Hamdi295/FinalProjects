            <h2>Smart Home</h2>
            <p>For my final bachelor project, I developed a smart home prototype that integrates a mobile application for remote management. This innovative project not only earned me the highest marks in my program but also garnered an honorable mention for its design and functionality. The system allows users to control various home features, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to merge technology with practical applications, showcasing my skills in software development and IoT solutions.</p>

            <h2>E-commerce Website</h2>
            <p>In one of my standout projects, I developed an e-commerce website for SOTUFAC, a company dedicated to providing high-quality products. This project not only received positive feedback from my peers and instructors but also showcased my ability to create user-friendly and effective online platforms. The website features intuitive navigation and robust functionality, which enhances the shopping experience for customers. My efforts in this project were recognized and encouraged by my institute and teachers, further motivating me to explore the dynamic field of web development.</p>

            <h2>Engineer Final Project</h2>
            <p>As part of our final year project, we implemented a DevOps solution within KMF. To achieve
                this, we created an infrastructure using VMware ESXi with six virtual machines: one for
                GitLab, one for Jenkins, one for the staging environment, one for pfSense, one for Redmine,
                and one for SonarQube. We configured these VMs to enable continuous integration with
                webhooks and a container registry, ensuring smooth coordination across different stages of
                development. Additionally, we developed scripts to streamline the overall process and reduce
                human errors.Furthermore, we integrated Kubernetes into the staging VM, enabling efficient
                management of application deployment and scaling. This setup enhances our DevOps cycle
                by facilitating collaboration, automation, and code quality, while ensuring optimal security
                and project management.</p>
